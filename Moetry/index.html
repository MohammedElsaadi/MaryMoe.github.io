               <p>When you smile my world stops</p>
               <p>When you smile my heart drops</p>
               <p>I am stupified by your lips</p>
               <p>my brain goes to mush</p>
               <p>and just like an eclipse</p>
               <p>it really makes me blush</p>
               <p>when it's there by my action</p>
               <p>I feel such satisfaction</p>

                <p>In my heart there are lost ships</p>
                <p>but when you laugh, smile, or talk</p>
                <p>a lighthouse glows behind your lips</p>
                <p>for the ships to find the dock</p>

                <h2>Your Eyes</h2>
                <p>Your eyes are so round</p>
                <p>so wonderfully dark and brown</p>
                <p>that they catch light are sparkle and shimmer</p>
                <p>I find myself lost in their glimmer</p>

                <h2>Your Lessons</h2>
                <p>Every day of my life feels enriched</p>
                <p>as I learn from you and grow</p>
                <p>and together these lessons are stiched</p>
                <p>into a quilt of all the things I now know</p>
                <p>you teach me how to cook</p>
                <p>you teach me lessons in love</p>
                <p>if each lesson was a chapter of a book</p>
                <p>then it would grow and tower above</p>

                <p>There are so many places</p>
                <p>that we wish to go and see</p>
                <p>there are so many faces</p>
                <p>that will see you with me</p>
                <p>there is a whole world out there</p>
                <p>and it all seems so far away</p>
                <p>but think of all the memories we will share</p>
                <p>as we discover the world together one day</p>
